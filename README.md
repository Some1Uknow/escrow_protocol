# Freelance Escrow Smart Contract

A decentralized escrow system built on Solana using the Anchor framework for secure freelance transactions between clients and freelancers.

## Overview

This smart contract facilitates trustless transactions between clients and freelancers by holding funds in escrow until work is completed and approved. The system includes dispute resolution mechanisms and timeout protections for both parties.

## Program Information

- **Program ID**: `HWkW19PFehhdgfkGPHnTQTnfhcCQhMqokqGx3Vav7a3N`
- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Framework**: Anchor
- **Language**: Rust

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Escrow Creation**: Clients can create escrow accounts with specified amounts and freelancer addresses
- **Fund Deposit**: Secure deposit of SOL into the escrow account
- **Work Submission**: Freelancers can submit work links for client review
- **Approval System**: Clients can approve submitted work
- **Payment Release**: Approved payments are released to freelancers
- **Dispute Resolution**: Either party can initiate disputes
- **Refund Mechanism**: Automatic refunds for disputed or timed-out escrows

### Security Features
- **PDA-based Escrow Accounts**: Deterministic addresses using client and freelancer public keys
- **Authorization Checks**: Only authorized parties can perform specific actions
- **Status Validation**: State machine prevents invalid transitions
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic refunds after specified timeout periods
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs

## Escrow Workflow

1. **Initialize**: Client creates escrow with amount, freelancer address, and timeout period
2. **Fund**: Client deposits the agreed amount into the escrow
3. **Submit**: Freelancer submits completed work with a link
4. **Approve**: Client reviews and approves the submission
5. **Withdraw**: Freelancer withdraws the payment

### Alternative Flows
- **Dispute**: Either party can initiate a dispute for manual resolution
- **Refund**: Client receives refund in case of disputes or timeouts

## Escrow States

- `Pending`: Escrow created, awaiting funding
- `Funded`: Funds deposited, awaiting work submission
- `Submitted`: Work submitted, awaiting client approval
- `Approved`: Work approved, awaiting payment withdrawal
- `Complete`: Payment withdrawn, escrow finished
- `Disputed`: Dispute initiated, requires resolution
- `Refunded`: Funds returned to client

## Account Structure

### EscrowAccount
```rust
pub struct EscrowAccount {
    pub client: Pubkey,              // Client's public key
    pub freelancer: Pubkey,          // Freelancer's public key
    pub amount: u64,                 // Escrow amount in lamports
    pub status: EscrowStatus,        // Current escrow state
    pub work_link: String,           // Submitted work link
    pub bump: u8,                    // PDA bump seed
    pub created_at: i64,             // Creation timestamp
    pub funded_at: i64,              // Funding timestamp
    pub submitted_at: i64,           // Work submission timestamp
    pub approved_at: i64,            // Approval timestamp
    pub completed_at: i64,           // Completion timestamp
    pub disputed_at: i64,            // Dispute initiation timestamp
    pub refunded_at: i64,            // Refund timestamp
    pub dispute_timeout_days: u8,    // Timeout period in days
}
```

## Error Handling

The contract includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid status transitions
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Insufficient funds
- Invalid parameters
- Timeout violations

## Security Considerations

- All state transitions are validated
- Only authorized signers can perform actions
- PDA seeds ensure deterministic account addresses
- Input validation prevents malicious data
- Timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite locks
